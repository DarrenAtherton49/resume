This project is a continuation of my undergraduate dissertation, attempting to combine notions from artificial intelligence, persuasive technology and behaviour change/ motivation theories to develop dynamic, intelligent motivational applications for the purpose of motivating parents to help their young children acquire language. During this time, I undertook this research as a member of the Agent ART research group and in the context of the International Centre for Language and Communicative Development (LuCiD). For this project, I gained a great amount of knowledge on argument and computation theory, artificial intelligence, user modelling, persuasive/motivational technologies, behavioural theory and application interaction design. During this project I also gained important writing and communication skills, by submitting research material to peer-reviewed publication venues and giving corresponding presentations.",
